# Basic list exercises
# Fill in the definitions for the required functions. The main functions and the testing 
# has been handled, so when you run a program, you will get an output of how many testcases
# passed and how many didn't.

# A. alphanum Score
def alphanum_score(words):
	"""
	The function takes a list of words as its argument.
	Returns a score generated as follows,
		> Start with a net score of 0
		> If the element is a alpha-string, +1
		> If the element is a number-string, -1
	"""

	# Add your code here
	return


# B. Occurences
def occurences(words):
	"""
	The function takes a list of words as its argument.
	Returns a list sorted by the number of times the letter 'a' occurs.
	"""

	# Add your code here
	return


# C. Tuple Merge
def tuple_merge(tuples):
	"""
	The functions takes a list of 2-tuples as its argument.
	Returns a list of the form - 
		[tuples sorted by first element, tuples sorted by second element]
	"""

	# Add your code here
	return
