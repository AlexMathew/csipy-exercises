# The Grand Exercise
# This exercise covers most elements covered in the first three sessions. Time to put it all together !
# You will be writing this program from scratch. Function definitions, boilerplate and everything. 
# You don't necessarily have to finish the whole thing in the time allotted. Work on it as much as you
# can. Take your time and make sure you can write this whole thing yourself. 
# Refer to the documentation. Use StackOverflow. Ask one of us. And put it together yourself.

# This is what you have to do.
# > Run the program with a keyword argument, which can be --count or --set
# 	i.e, python words.py --count (or) python words.py --set
#   Handle the cases where the keyword argument is either not given, or not one of these two.
# > Read in the contents of the file "input.txt"
# > If the keyword argument is "--count", count the occurences of each word in the file text, 
#   and store the counts in a dictionary. Now, generate a string built from the list of words, 
#   sorted by occurence. Write this into "output.txt". So in your output file, you should have
#   the most occurring word first, the second most occurring word next, and so on.
# > If the keyword argument is "--set", generate a set of all words in the file text, and generate
#   a string built from a sorted list of all the unique words in the text. Write this into "output.txt".
#   So in your output file, you should have the alphabetically first word appearing first, and so on.

# You might want to look into the join() method for strings. Check out help !
